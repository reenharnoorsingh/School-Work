The link for the video. I have made diagrams for better understanding of how the program works
but if my voice is not clear or if you dont understand my reasoning in the video for some reason
here is what I want to say!

What happens after removing else exit(11);   :
    Answer: Instead of exiting the parent process just continues and 
    so the loop runs again and that’s why it prints child process again.
    The if part executed and a child process is made 
    But when we remove the else part , 
    Even if the cpid isn’t 0 and the child is not created, 
    it doesn’t exit and it makes a child process


Thanks
Harnoor
