Explanation of pcsc1.txt :-

In the original program parent runs and then it switches to child process 
where as when we make the required edits for the first case only the Child process 
runs and returns the User defined signal, this is probably because 
when we interchange pause() in the child process compared to the original reference case.
The child process is started with that print statement of child is executed and then the signal is printed,
so first the kill() is called and then the pause() is called

Explanation of pcsc2.txt :-

When we interchange the position of pause() in parent process in refrence to originial code 
First pause() is called and then kill() is called in the parent process 
but are we are in an infinte loop the program doesnt terminate

Explanation of pcsc3.txt :-

When we interchange the pause() and kill(getppid(),SIGUSR1) 
compared to the original one in both parent and child process
The child process begins first and then the signal prints. 
So the kill() is called first and then pause().
