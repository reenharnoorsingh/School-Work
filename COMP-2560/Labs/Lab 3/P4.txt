a) File Size: -rw-r--r-- 1 reen temp 418 Oct 11 18:51 filesize2.c

b)	 fseek(fd, 10L, SEEK_SET);
	 putc(-1, fd);	
	 rewind(fd); 

     With using the fseek function we set the pointer of at
     the 10th position using SEEK_SET. By using putc we over-write
     the file with -1 (which is EOF). And then by using the rewind function
     we printout the the new contents with EOF at the pointer position 10.

c) File size for uncommented filesize2.c is 10

The sizes reported in a and c are different because after we remove the comments, 
the program terminates after the first 10 characters as it finds a -1.
so the size is only 10.
whereas in the original, the program doesnt terminate.
