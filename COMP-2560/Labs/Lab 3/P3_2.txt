the value of char c is changed to unsigned char c.Now,
because EOF is a signed int and ch is an unsigned char.the do-while loop will never end because 
in the statement ch!=EOF,
we mean (unsigned char)ch ! = (int)EOF
this can not be right.
the range of unsigned char is 0-255 whereas EOF is -1.

therefore ch can never be equal to EOF, hence the loop never terminates.
