(ii) A short text file explaining what the cause of the problem might be (why the file descriptors
are corrupted?). The answer to this question is probably beyond the scope of this course. Use
your best guess.

ANSWER -
while((n1=read(fd1, buffer, 512) > 0)) , it should not be 512, but 1 so that it reads one data at a time.
Also,in the loop ,the comparison is not proper, because we are only comparing the read part with 0, 
but we should be comparing n1.
Q-FILE DESCRIPTORS can be corrupted 
ANS-because they may have an invalid value.
it is maybe negative ordoes not represent the currently open file.



Q2(f part)- Compare the values of fd1 and fd2 you saw in e) with the values of fd1 and fd2 you
inspected in d). Are the fd1 and fd2 values the same in d) and e). Whatâ€™s the n1
value? Is it what you expected? 

ANSWER-no, the values of fd1 and fd2 are different. 
The values for fd1 and fd2 for part d) was 2 and 4 respectively but in part e) there is a 
huge difference in those values fd1 and fd2 become 845440544 and 741434470 and n1 when printed out is 1 which
is expected because the values change when execution stops at different points.
